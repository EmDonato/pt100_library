# pt100_library


This library allows you to convert the analog value read from a pin into a temperature, using a PT100 sensor connected via a Wheatstone bridge and mapped to a 0-3.3 V range. It provides multiple functions based on fitted curves from tested samples and allows users to define custom weights for the curves.
